# Summary: Rick

## Day 233 PROVE (2026-10-10): long-version Thm H + d-matrix cold referee read — proof SURVIVES; notation defects fixed (WIP 9211e5d)
- Re-derived §5 (Thm 5.1 = Thm H, Prop 5.5, Cor 5.2) from the printed text, line by line. No mathematical gap.
- Defects found were conventions carried between sections, the predicted blind spot:
  - the in_{v0} residue field was printed Q(x) but must be Q(t)(x) in §5;
  - **no pairing was defined anywhere** in the long version, although both ⟨,⟩ and ⟨,⟩_t are used. Clio's FPSAC Finding 1, worse. Notation now defines both, with "undecorated = Hall";
  - m_v, P/Q/b, Kostka(-Foulkes), [n]_q and φ_r were undefined;
  - the Hikita Cor 3.10 locator was missing (verified first-hand).
- All 4 FPSAC e44e29f fixes are ported, plus the JL Thm 2.6 locator and the widened Clio Thm D sentence.
- New independent printed check, |μ|+k≤7, now includes Thm H(2) via Gram–Schmidt HL (not Pieri), both Cor formulas, N[t] and t=1. All True; 4 negative controls fire (scripts/day233/check_H_printed_v2_n7.log).
- **INVENTORY's "log clean" claim was false:** 14 pre-existing overfull hboxes (max 40pt), 0 new. Queued as polish.
- Missing artifact: the "wake233 FPSAC printed sweep" file PROVE.md referenced does not exist.
- Pre-existing registry boundary advisory: the N_imports premise is graded computed under a proved node. Left for after 11-15.
- File: proofs/2026-10-11-day233-longversion-thmH-referee-read.md.

## Day 232 dream (2026-10-09): Browse 172's bar-op "explanation" corrected; (N) imports may be one abstract theorem; no grade changes
- **Status board:**
  - FPSAC at d7bca5e. Deadline 2026-11-15 (37 days).
  - Robin got the defaults email in Wake 232 and has not replied (silent since 10-05). Nothing gets submitted without his explicit yes.
  - Clio is cold-reading Thm 6.6 at 0dcdc5e.
  - Long version: 29 pp at 401a40a, plus snippet 412adbf.
- **Correction:** Browse 172 said DLMF arXiv:2609.23866 (a DAHA bar op, involutive only at q=1) "may explain the Day 217 ι death". **Wrong as stated.** ι=Ψ∘β is involutive at all (s,t). What died on Day 218 was *positivity*.
  - The real residue: s=1 (⇔ q=1, since s=q^{-1}) is β-stable and was **never probed** (Day 218 probed only t=s^a).
  - Kill test filed in the `connections/2026-10-02-reflection-R-is-a-bar-involution.md` Day 232 addendum. Registry note added to `iota-bar-involution-canonical-basis-of-star` (stays dead-end). WIP registry copy synced.
- **Crown (hunch, unregistered):** `connections/2026-10-09-N-imports-are-a-presentation-check.md`.
  - (C3) simple spectrum is free at generic s once Y_i is triangular on monomials (the s-exponents of y_i(λ) recover λ).
  - (C1) is Bernstein's lattice commutativity in the ABSTRACT extended affine Hecke algebra, once our T_i, π satisfy its relations. The remaining check is π²T_{m−1}=T_1π² or the located form.
  - Target: (N)'s imports = 1 abstract theorem (locator UNVERIFIED) + 2 checks. Post-FPSAC.
- Journal `dream-journal/2026-10-09-day232-dream.md`. No PERSONALITY edit.

## Browse 172 (2026-10-09): Haiman = FPSAC 2027 invited speaker (watch); DAHA bar op 2609.23866; Dołęga citer cluster corrected
- New (abstract-only, in sources.json):
  - Fischer–Gangl–Gutiérrez–Kumari 2610.08500: types B/C/BC HL character expansions ⇒ Warnaar JT identities. Low overlap.
  - DLMF 2609.23866: see the dream correction above.
  - Mazorchuk–Srivastava 2609.10152: hybrid KL bases.
- FPSAC 2027 Galway, July 5–9. **Mark Haiman is an invited speaker** (scoop watch only).
- Dołęga 1707.02656 citers = the Dołęga–Kowalski–Gerber–Torres cluster, not Jing's group (earlier logs were wrong). Jing–Liu: 9 citers, saturated. Hikita 2503.23597: 3 citers, all chromatic.
- MO: 509068 (hook-character sums), 496091 (KF stabilisation), 512671 (H̃ vs H normalisation). SE API: use `/questions?tagged=X&fromdate=`. Log `reading/2026-10-09-browse172.md`.

## Day 232 PROVE (2026-10-09): blockmult printed check n≤8 ALL OK; (C2) Bernstein DERIVED — (N) imports now (C1)+(C3)
- **(a) thm:blockmult (longversion Thm 7.8) vs its PRINTED statement.**
  - n=6 has only **3** non-coarsening κ≥2 pairs. This is structural: the smallest κ=1 non-coarsening block is (2,2)→(3,1). All 3 OK (Fraction engine).
  - n=6 all κ≥2: 37/37 OK. n=7 non-coarsening: 11/11. n=8 non-coarsening: 29/29.
  - The mod-p runs use a 2^61−1 engine in μ_1 variables (stability). It was cross-validated against the Fraction engine on 199/199 triples. t ∈ {3/5,−2}.
  - The side-claim "every factor κ=1" holds over all 7421 tuples n≤8. Negative controls fail as they should.
  - Zero leads occur only at t=−2 (0=0), each via a (1,1,1)→(3) block. That is Open Problem (2), not a defect.
  - My own first checker wrongly demanded LHS≠0 at t=−2. Fixed, and the runs were redone.
  - `proofs/2026-10-10-day232-blockmult-printed-n6-check.md`, `scripts/day232/`. Grade unchanged (proved).
- **(b) (C2) PROVED, not imported.**
  - (B2) is formal from the word. (R4) turns it into two relations with error terms ±(t−1)Y_{i+1}. Their sum gives [T_i,Y_i+Y_{i+1}]=0; their product with (C1) gives [T_i,Y_iY_{i+1}]=0.
  - Far commutation IS formal: braid + (R3) πT_k=T_{k+1}π, two cases.
  - It holds for ANY π with (R3), so it covers the paper's twisted π too.
  - (R4)/(Br) are proved in-file (Br via the Artin basis + a complete finite symbolic check).
  - SymPy check (m=3,4 untwisted, m=3 twisted; all monomials of degree ≤3): all True.
  - `proofs/2026-10-10-day232-C2-bernstein-derivation.md`. Registry node `C2_bernstein_from_B2_R4` (proved, premise) under NS.
  - LaTeX snippet `longversion/appendix-C2-bernstein.tex` is NOT input, because the paper is (N)-free.
- **The (N) gap is now one item:** (C3)-nonsymmetric, the simple joint spectrum of E_λ (load-bearing in NS step 1). (C1) = DFK L2.7 per Clio, not first-hand.

## Wake 232 (2026-10-09): Robin defaults email SENT; FPSAC d7bca5e (Clio Thm D widened); long version 401a40a
- **Robin** silent since 10-05 → sent the one-shot email: one proposed default per FPSAC \todo, "reply ok or correct any line", nothing submitted without his yes (`for-collaborator/2026-10-09-wake232-fpsac-todo-defaults.md`).
- **Clio UID 350:** her Lean signed-exponent obstruction is sorry-free (all e_i∈ℤ + quotient form); Thm D ITSELF is not formalised (no HL/Kostka defs in Lean) → never write "Lean-verified" beside it. FPSAC sentence widened to t^c∏(1−t^{d_i})^{e_i}, e_i∈ℤ (WIP d7bca5e); 1-p ack PDF sent (cc Robin). She cold-reads Thm 6.6 at 0dcdc5e + tests cor:G(d) for t>0; her ℓ(ν)=3 gap waits on her report. Peer copies saved under peers/clio/.
- **MacBeth UID 349** (75603ad second pass) was already answered by Wake 231's review (sent 00:13) — nothing owed.
- **Long version:** C_{a,b}→\mathcal C_{a,b} (11 occ.), 0 overfull present, \wip = title footnote (Robin). WIP 401a40a, 29 pp.
- **PROVE 232** = (a) n=6 non-coarsening blockmult check from the printed statement, (b) (C2) Bernstein derivation.


## Day 231 + Day 230 dream (2026-10-08/09): pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-09-pre-day232-dream.md`)
- **Day 231 dream:** crown `connections/2026-10-09-the-excluded-part-is-the-hecke-bridge.md`. (N) is the only Path 3 content, and the long version excludes it. The (C2) hunch was proved in PROVE 232. The n=6 empty log has been redone (PROVE 232).
- **Browse 171:** FPSAC 11-15 re-confirmed via curl. Scoop risk CLEAR. Foissy 2610.06256 (combinatorial twisted bialgebras, Exch terminal) is unread.
- **Day 231 PROVE:** long version `work-in-progress/longversion/longversion.tex` written in full (WIP 56f0201). The ℓ-column proof subsumes 207b. (N)/square edges are excluded on purpose. Printed-statement checks `scripts/day231/check_*_printed.log` ALL True.
- **Wake 231:** two-row Green = Jing–Liu 2104.04411 §2 (credited). Cor G(d) sign proved (registry corGd_grade_20261009). MacBeth reviews sent (75603ad, 242c7ea). FPSAC 0dcdc5e.
- **Day 230 dream:** the s=0 end is a lattice limit (hunch). The PDF is the claim. HT "two-row" read refused (wrong index).

## Days 229–230 (wake / PROVE / dream), 2026-10-08: pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-09-pre-day231-dream.md`)
- Day 230 PROVE: FPSAC referee cold read. 12 pp restored, jargon/undefined symbols fixed, OP5 overclaim cut, Thm 6.6 from the printed text 123/123 (WIP 3f7d825). `proofs/2026-10-09-day230-fpsac-referee-read.md`.
- Wake 230: R0 = Hikita 2503.23597 **Lemma 3.1 + Cor 3.9** (Browse 148 locator was wrong). 207b F1–F4 repaired (aeffb18/8f8e63d). Bib 5/6 verified (483bc39).
- Day 229 dream: two-row Green = sl₂ multiplicity-one (KF monomial ⇒ Young). Two-row formula itself = Jing–Liu 2104.04411 §2 (credited Wake 231).
- Day 229 PROVE: FPSAC round 3 (WIP 37875af); two-row Green proved by III (7.6′) + Young's rule.

## Day 228 (wake / PROVE / dream), 2026-10-07: pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-08-pre-day230-dream.md`)
- **Wake 228:** v=2 gate lifted; Thm C (N)-free (DFK18 + Macdonald VI); Cor G(b),(c) checked-sober with the sign (−1)^{ℓ−1} fixed; bib locators `reading/2026-10-07-wake228-fpsac-bib-locators.md`; FPSAC 11-15 + mandatory AI declaration verified.
- **PROVE 228 (WIP 2f0f2fe):** gauge-invariant separator J=L(1^4)L(22)/L(211)^2 (⋆=HT; Dołęga ⊕ ≡3/2; computed, `separator_day228`). Two-row × two-part Green formula proved (155/155, `two-row-specialisation-thm25`). Prop M from Cor pieri. `proofs/2026-10-07-day228-two-row-green-and-separator.md`.
- **Dream 228:** crowns `connections/2026-10-07-two-row-green-is-a-cup-diagram-trace.md` (superseded at the trace level by Day 229) and `connections/2026-10-07-separators-are-torus-invariants.md` (FPSAC positioning vs Dołęga).

## Day 227 dream + PROVE (2026-10-07): pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-07-pre-day228-dream.md`)
- **Dream 227:** crown `connections/2026-10-07-the-slice-you-close-is-the-index-you-iterate.md` (row extraction costs ℓ(λ), residues cost ℓ(μ)). Stop auditing; the Thm 2.5 gate is Morris 1977 only. Stale registry novelty fields annotated.
- **PROVE 227:** JL (2.33) ≠ telescope of Thm 2.5 (outcome b; sibling evaluations of Jing CT). Prop 2.3 cold recheck PASSED. W evaluation-independent via Day 225 Cor 2.3. `proofs/2026-10-08-day227-jingliu-telescope.md`, WIP 21363ac.

## Days 226–227 wake (2026-10-06/07): pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-07-pre-day227-dream.md`)
- **Wake 226:** dictionary Φ_a(P_ρ;x,y) = (1−t^x)(1−t^y)X^λ_{(x,y)}/b_λ (350/350, 590/590), so Thm 2.5 = class-two-part Green slice. FPSAC skeleton v0 (WIP 0c912bd). Its "Morris = Math Z 80" was WRONG; the correct citation is **81 (1963)**, DOI 10.1007/bf01111657.
- **PROVE 226:** cold recheck PASSED (Thm 1.1 independent proof, L2.1–2.2, Thm 2.5, Thm 4.2 kill test by hand). `proofs/2026-10-07-day226-cold-recheck-class4.md`.
- **Browse 166:** Jing–Liu 2104.04411 (2.37) "AT RISK" alarm, **WITHDRAWN** by the Day 226 dream: their formula restricts the HL index (the transposed slice). `connections/2026-10-06-jing-liu-is-the-transpose-slice.md`.
- **Day 226 dream:** Browse 166 alarm = slice mix-up (name the restricted index; `feedback_name_the_restricted_index`). Residual owners were Morris 1977 + JL Thm 2.7, and the latter was closed Day 227. Registry `novelty_dream226`.
- **Wake 227:**
  - Clio's Theorem H verdict (UID 331): "NOVEL within a named corpus, folklore-adjacent". Corollary d = the classical e→HL matrix (Kirillov math/9803006 §3.2). W's second proof shares Lemma 1.4. s=q^{-1}. Registry `peer_review_clio_2026-10-06`; FPSAC e4cd4cb.
  - Morris LNM 579 (1977), DOI 10.1007/BFb0090015, = ℓ(λ)=2 HL index per JL p.11 (~85%, second-hand). PDF asked of Robin.
  - MacBeth referee report sent (WIP 6f57b14; two ERRORS in U).
  - Clio has no Macdonald copy and is computing X^λ_(x,y) independently.

## Day 225 dream (2026-10-06) — v=2 layer CLOSED; t-strings = Frobenius orbits ⇒ Thm 2.5 likely Green/Morris-owned; stop opening fronts, write FPSAC
- **Crown** `connections/2026-10-06-t-strings-are-frobenius-orbits.md`:
  - p_n ↔ Coxeter torus ↔ one string (Thm 1.5).
  - p_xp_y ↔ two Frobenius orbits ↔ two strings (Thm 2.5). qbin·t^{−AB} in Sh_{A,B} is a Hall number.
  - ⇒ Thm 2.5 is probably two-part Green polynomial data (Morris 1963 Math Z 81 / Macdonald III.7). What stays ours is the ⋆-lead transfer (Thm 4.2/Cor 4.3).
  - Prediction: v=3 needs three strings; test whether the multishuffle sum factors pairwise (Wick, Day 212).
- **Partial cold recheck (by hand):** Lemma 2.4 (cross factors, both telescopes, A=B=1, final identity), the partial fractions, and the §2.3 example −(1−t²)(3+t²) all hold.
  Still owed: Thm 1.1, Lemmas 2.1–2.2, the Thm 4.2 assembly. Registry: recheck + novelty notes on `gprime-v2-class4-open` and `gamma-a-offdiagonal-closed-form` (both copies). Grade stays **proved**, NOT checked-sober.
- **Questions:**
  - NEW `q-thm25-vs-green-polynomials-morris.md` (gate; take Clio's III.7 offer, UID 330).
  - CLOSED: flow-forests (duplicate Q-/q- files merged into `closed/`) and HT 2609.29957 (RELATED, wake 225).
  - FPSAC v7.5: 40 days left. G′(v=2) can be promoted only after the recheck + Green citation. Stop new fronts; start writing by ~Oct 20.
- **Browse 165** (`reading/2026-10-06-browse165.md`) ran from a stale queue. HT was "top open" although the wake had resolved it; "read KL before class 4" came after class 4 was closed. Useful residue:
  - Okada Cor 6.8 = t=−1 (Morris 1964), NOT generic-t HL Pieri.
  - 2606.21041 NCSym "star" name collision.
  - Konvalinka–Lauve 1201.1404 eq (3) = classical e_r HL Pieri (cite for H).
  - FPSAC 2026-11-15 re-confirmed.
- **Inbox:** Clio UID 330 says the H verdict comes in her cycle 1 (pending). MacBeth accepted the W=ℕ[ε]/ε² scope fix. No Robin reply.

## Day 225 (wake / PROVE), 2026-10-06: pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-06-pre-day226-dream.md`)
- **PROVE:** CLASS 4 CLOSED. `proofs/2026-10-07-day225-class4-hopf-route.md`.
  - Thm 1.1: CT adjoint against the HL kernel K.
  - Thm 2.5: two t-strings + Sh_{A,B}, 229/229.
  - Thm 4.2: kill test (3,3,3)→(7,2) exact.
  - Cor 4.3: all v=2 leads closed.
  - Dead: the X⊔Y Hopf split.
- **Wake:** Clio PDF 214db68 (class-4 escalation). HT 2609.29957 = RELATED (G survives). Box Complement mechanism = DFK 1704.00154 Rem 3.3 + Hikita Cor 3.10 (CITE). Clio graded 207b PROVED (modulo R0).

## Day 224 (wake / PROVE / dream), 2026-10-05 — pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-06-pre-day225-dream-prune.md`)
- PROVE: Box Complement Thm 2.1 c_{N^ℓ−λ,N^ℓ−μ}=s^{…}c_{λμ} and the Column Lemma. Thm 3.1 lin_e(e_k⋆G) re-proves 207b. Thm 6.1 block multiplicativity. Closed c_{λ,(n−1,1)}. G′ positivity DEAD. `proofs/2026-10-06-day224-Gprime-second-order.md`.
- Dream crown `connections/2026-10-05-lead-is-exp-of-connected-and-duality-symmetric.md`: lead = exp(connected); Box Complement = contragredient (D_∞ orbit table); Hopf route for class 4 (worked in another coordinate, Day 225).
- Wake: Clio W-note fbdf2c0 (understated n=7; corrected in 214db68). HL-pairing hunch = tautology. H absent from DFK 1704/1505 (sub-agent source read).

## Day 223 dream (2026-10-05) — the lead is a PRIMITIVE PAIRING; H/A novelty de-prioritized for FPSAC; stale "Clio-reviewed" fixed
- Full stanza in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-05-pre-day224-dream.md`. Crown `connections/2026-10-05-lead-is-a-primitive-pairing.md` ([e_n]f = (−1)^{n−1}⟨f,p_n⟩; cumulant shape forced by primitivity; weights = q-dims via Day 223 Thm 1.5). A/H go to FPSAC with no novelty claim. "207b Clio-reviewed" inflation fixed (her read still owed).

## Day 223 PROVE (2026-10-05) — STAR LEMMA == Theorem W (misidentified); W gets a (KF)-free 2nd proof + cold recheck PAID; B-matrix PROVED
- Full stanza in archive (pre-day224-dream). `proofs/2026-10-06-day223-G-by-vertex-deletion.md`, WIP 305bf47. Star lemma = Thm W verbatim. New: (KF)-free W proof, Thm 1.5 lin_e T_k f = (−1)^d[n]/[k]·f(1,…,t^{k−1}) (folklore-level), W cold recheck closed, Thm 7.1 B-matrix.

Lemma R Ψ_{1/s,1/t}=Ψ^{-1}; Thm A (s=∞ → HL P_{μ'}(x;t)); Thm B (t=0 → ωH̃_μ(x;s), now = DFK15); Prop C collapse coefficient (gives Hikita Thm C(ii)); Cor D op form (b). `proofs/2026-10-02-day217e-boundary-of-the-st-square.md`, node `square-theorem-all-edges-day217e`. PDF to Clio (WIP dd35498).
- **217 wake:** (N) folklore-implicit (DFK 1704.00154; BGHT (I.12)(iii); BGLX 1405.0316 Conj 2.1). t=1/s line proved. ⋆-positivity dead in natural bases. GGS OP4 dead as target. MacBeth torsor review sent (fails at Z/8).
- **217 dream:** ι bar-involution hunch (now dead); ∇-avatar novelty search (now moot). Validator: `python3 code/registry_validate.py <registry.json> --proofs-dir /home/agent/projects`; trust enum stale (`sketched`, `peer-claimed`, `checked-sober` flagged, pre-existing).

## Days 215 dream – 216 dream (pointer lines; full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-02-pre-day217-dream.md`)
- **216 dream:** (Sym,⋆)≅(Sym,·) via 𝒩. Crown: t=1/s is LR × ribbon monodromy (since proved as a corollary, Day 217 wake). Hopf hunch, unregistered: Δ_⋆ = (𝒩⊗𝒩)Δ𝒩^{-1}, so on t=1/s the failure of 𝒩 to be a coalgebra map is R₂₁R. Is it a braided Hopf algebra?
- **216c PROVE:** (N) PROVED for all k. Lemma (I) [e_1(Y),X_1]=(s−1)X_1Y_1 → nonsymmetric Gaussian γ̂X_iγ̂^{-1}=Y^•_i → 207b. Cherednik facts C1–C3 are machine-checked, but their locators are unverified. WIP f223c5d.
- **216b PROVE:** (N) found. Theorem H′ (t→∞ edge = q-Whittaker ωQ′_μ(x;s)). (KF) E_kF = Σ P_{ρ+1^k}(x;t)(Q′_ρ[(s−1)X;t])^⊥F, proved. `proofs/2026-10-01-day216b-theorem-H-prime-nabla-transport.md`.
- **216 wake:** Ψ_s is not a Macdonald *basis* (Groebner [1]), but the *operator* is Macdonald-diagonal. Theorem H's corollary matrix d is the classical e→HL transition (HKKOTY; Kirillov math/9803006 Thm 3.4), so present it as an identification only. A peer's grade comes from their registry, not their review table.
- **215 dream:** Theorem H sober re-read holds. Crown: ⋆ interpolates e-multiplication (s=1) and HL multiplication (s=0); at s=t=0 it is the dominance zeta function. Negative controls need the involution sweep.
- **Browse 156/157:** the arXiv+citation sweep for (N)/H′ is clean. MO/SE work via `curl api.stackexchange.com` (WebFetch is blocked). FPSAC deadline reconfirmed. Hikita 2503.23597 still has 3 citers. GGS has a self-citation 2601.22287 (unchecked vs OP4).

## Days 214 dream – 215 PROVE (pointer lines; full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-01-pre-day216-dream.md`)
- **Day 215 PROVE: Theorem H PROVED.** The s→0 limit of ⋆ in the b-basis (b_μ = s^{n(μ)}e_μ) is t^{−C(k,2)}·HL e_k-multiplication. Corollary: d_{λμ} ∈ ℕ[t] is the e→HL transition, which is CLASSICAL (HKKOTY; Kirillov math/9803006 Thm 3.4).
  - `proofs/2026-10-01-day215-theorem-H-s0-limit-is-HL.md`. Nodes `theorem-H-s0-star-is-HL-pieri` and `d-equals-hall-littlewood-transition` are proved.
- **Day 215 wake:** d(t) = t^{−n(λ')}⟨e_λ, H̃_{μ'}⟩ computed for n ≤ 7. The DS novelty audit is clean on Hikita (`reading/2026-10-01-DS-novelty-audit.md`). Clio UID 306 endorses (TC), conditional on 207b.
- **Day 214 dream:** at s=t=0, ⋆ = the dominance zeta function (seed Q4); `connections/2026-09-30-dominance-zeta-is-the-crystal-limit-of-star.md`.
  - The arc table: 207b e_k⋆e_r, 206b W_r/τ_r, 209 (TC), 212 (★ℓ), 214 DS all lengths. All are proved; review status is in the registry.
  - FPSAC 2027 abstracts are due **2026-11-15** (SLC format, 6–12 pp, AI declaration). `questions/q-fpsac-2027-writeup.md`.
- **Day 214 PROVE:** DS for all lengths, with exact up-set support and val_s c_{λμ} = n(μ). `proofs/2026-09-30-day214-DS-all-lengths-PROVED.md`.

## Days 212–214 (pointer lines; full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-09-30-pre-day214-dream.md`)
- **214 PROVE (09-30):** DS for all lengths plus the Theorem 2 stretch (WIP 5ff6da3, b5ccc50).
  - Lemma A: a Gauss-valuation bound. Lemma B: the t=0 peel recursion (Ryser); the Peel Lemma was brute-forced on 10,788 triples with n ≤ 11.
  - Lesson: `feedback_termwise_bound_basis_choice`. Scripts in `scripts/day214/`.
- **Browse 154 (09-30):** FPSAC deadline is live. Wick audit clean. `reading/2026-09-30-browse154.md`.
- **213 wake (09-30):**
  - (TC) and (★ℓ) PDFs sent to Clio (ca17c82; the (TC) node is `two-column-gf-rule`).
  - MacBeth o_ν slices registered peer-claimed (7d58ead).
  - DS length 2 proved from 207b (46b691a, `proofs/2026-09-30-day213-DS-length2-from-207b.md`).
  - Wick bilinearity computed: B_n = (Y−S)(1−X)/(1−1/T) + (X−1/S)(1−Y)/(1−T), `scripts/day213/wick_kernel_check.py`, node `pairwise-kernel-wick-bilinear`.
- **212 dream / PROVE (09-30):**
  - (★ℓ) proved; (Z) is the residue theorem for ∏(w−μ_c)/((w−1)∏(w−λ_c)) (WIP 05666cc).
  - The Day 210 ℓ=3/4 kill test survived with negative controls; the version-A prefactor was WRONG.
  - Day 211: the aha_221 "mismatch" was a float-exponent harness bug, which can only fake NONZEROS (DS caveat in WIP 2d6c02c).
  - Hunch: the pairwise kernel is a Wick contraction (`connections/2026-09-30-pairwise-kernel-is-wick-contraction.md`), so the pairwise shape is NOT novelty evidence.
  - Clio UID 301: W_r and e_k⋆e_r stand.

## Days 205–211 (pointer lines; full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-09-26-pre-day207-dream.md`, `…-2026-09-29-pre-day209-dream.md`, `…-2026-09-30-pre-day212-dream.md`)
- **209 dream (09-29):** straightening-free promoted to proved as a corollary of (TC) (WIP 6f00fb9). `connections/2026-09-29-residue-function-is-the-whole-proof.md` predicted P-ℓ; confirmed Day 212.
- **209 PROVE (09-29):** (TC) two-column rule PROVED for all k (`proofs/2026-09-29-day209-two-column-TC-PROVED.md`, WIP 1e92c63). The t=0 one-column law min(Geom(s),μ) was PROVED for all k, r (Day 208).
- **Browse 152 (09-29):** Graf 2511.01114 (Jing operator via a deformed Bernstein operator); KOS 2605.16773 row-product coefficients; BW 2405.00756 has only a self-citation, so the EHA↔AHA dictionary gap is confirmed empty. `reading/2026-09-29-browse152.md`.
- **208 wake (09-26 → 09-29):**
  - (TC) conjectured (fit on Γ_1..Γ_3, blind-exact at k=4,5); straightening-free kill test survived; t=0 corollary proved for all k, r; 12th audit clean. WIP 300eb31.
  - Mail 09-26: Day 207b PDF to Clio; MacBeth answered on cross-equation (c), which is not always solvable (|G|=8, 16).
- **Browse 151 (09-29):** BW 2405.00756 v2 (e_r(X) side); MVP 2407.05362 (t=0 multiline queues, precedent in shape for Q4); MO 411889 contrast (t=0 HL straightening gives one term); Jing 1991 B_n; FPSAC deadline unposted. `reading/2026-09-29-browse151.md`.
- **207 dream (09-26):** the e-basis dodges straightening (`connections/2026-09-26-e-basis-dodges-straightening.md`); t=0 mixture; registry paths and sync fixed (WIP ab8caef/2932947).
- **207 wake (09-26):** k-fold kernel passes k=3,4,5; general formula fit on k ≤ 4 and blind-confirmed at k=5; ₂φ₁ form of F_n (computed n ≤ 6); **DS(r,1,1) PROVED** all r ≥ 2 (`proofs/2026-09-26-day207-DS-r11-proved.md`, WIP e99cb59). Clio M-convexity re-review PDF sent (73bb200/bb48fa1).
- **Browse 150 (09-26):** BW–Orr 2410.13642 Prop 4.2 = stable symmetrizer, §7.2 e_1-only Pieri; prior-art risk list (Shimozono–Zabrocki math/0001168, Venkateswaran 2308.10844, Bhattacharya 2407.14652); Fu–Hu 2609.19608 affine quantum Schur–Weyl (Path 3); FPSAC 2027 Galway Jul 5–9, deadline unpublished; Hikita 2503.23597 still 3 citers. MO blocked for agents. `reading/2026-09-26-browse150.md`.
- **206 dream / 206b PROVE (09-25):** W_r = e_2⋆e_r PROVED; Lemma 1 / τ_r PROVED; the coset symmetrizer is Jing's operator at k=2 (proved), `computed` at k=3.
- **205 dream / 205b / 205 wake (09-25):** W_r was the bottleneck; (L1)-(L4) and Sub-Lemma Z PROVED; τ^(3) closed form (computed). Browse 148: R0 closed (Hikita Def 3.4 / Lemma 3.3 quoted). [locator corrected wake 230: Lemma 3.1/Cor 3.9]

## Days 190-204 — Hikita ⋆-Pieri arc (pointer lines; full text in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-09-25-pre-day205-dream-prune.md`)
- **204 wake (09-18):** Clio's factorization τ_r = −(q²−1)[r+2]_t(q t^{r+1} − q + t + 1)/(q³[2]_t) verified sober. Prediction 1 at k=3 refuted (superseded by the Day 205 template). Sub-Lemma Z reduced to (L1)-(L4). WIP push 2885dcb.
- **203 dream + PROVE (09-17/18):** R7 identity proved (Newton + intertwiner). Sub-Lemma Z checked-sober. Thibon B_1² = αΔ_2 + αB_1 + 2B_2 is the stable-limit template.
- **202 wake + dream (09-17):** R5 exhausted. R6 (BW 2310.10249) opened then REFUTED (spherical vs level-1). Thibon-Δ_3 corollary RETRACTED. R7 is the sole route.
- **201 PROVE:** Vertex B (Jack) refuted. p_3(Y)-Pieri: 5 r-indep + 2 r-dep coefficients. r-independence comes from Newton cancellation.
- **200 wake:** τ_r closed form. A^{(2)} = p_2(Y) refuted. Five-defect PDF to Clio.
- **196-199:** DS (Dominance-Support) conjecture 22-for-22, leading q^{-n(λ)}. p_2(Y)-Pieri Lemma. D'Adderio route (D_(a) = e_a(Y)) REFUTED Day 197.
- **193-195:** e_3⋆e_r and e_4⋆e_r full closed forms (quasi-Vandermonde P_a). R1 (Stokman–Rains) refuted. BW 2405.00756 MISS. (Re) anchor retracted (AP Thm 38).
- **190-192:** X_{P_2}, X_{P_3}(q,t) via the Hikita recipe. e_2⋆e_2 closed; e_2⋆e_r conjectured (= W_r, still computed only). Clio retraction-of-retraction. MVL/Lemma 2A proved. Browse 141: the e_a⋆e_b (a ≥ 2) slot is open.

## Days 185-188 arc (2026-09-10 – 2026-09-11) — BDI/Hopf and h-basis $(q)$-GF hunches KILLED; retractions sent same day

- **Day 185 PROVE (2026-09-10):** BDI/Hopf $(1+t)$ hunch REFUTED. LHS is length-diagonal (support $\ell \le 2$); Zabrocki H_t exchange is length-shifting composition → different sub-algebras of $\mathrm{End}(\Lambda)$; no dictionary. Registry: `bdi-hopf-analogue-of-1+t = refuted`.
- **Day 185 dream:** BDI/Hopf consolidated as refuted; NC-geode/free-cumulants/FGCCHA triangle surfaces; free-cumulant hunch for $b_k$ queued.
- **Day 186 wake (Rule 11 fire #15):** free-cumulant hunch REFUTED numerically. Speicher-Nica $\kappa(b) = (3,18,228,3414,57051)$ ≠ $a_k = (3,18,282,5268,109647)$. Correct framing: $a_k = \mathrm{INVERTi}(b_k)$ = **Boolean** cumulants of $b_k$ (Milnor-Moore tautology). Silver lining: $\kappa$ is NOT in OEIS — new 4th sequence in Rick's $b_k$ family. Empirical h-basis $(q)$-GF $Z(z) = H_-(z)/(1-K(z))$ found (seed for Day 187 PROVE).
- **Day 187 PROVE (Rule 11 fire #16):** three h-basis $(q)$-GF forms upgraded `computed`→`checked-sober` on $n=1..8$. **All three later killed by Day 188 novelty audit** (SW 2010, Ellzey 2017, AP 2018).
- **Day 187 dream:** FPSAC anchor v1 hung on "manifestly $q$-positive $e$-basis expansion" — LATER KILLED. Two combinatorial proof routes for (Re) queued.
- **Day 188 wake (Rule 11 fire #17):** novelty audit KILLS Day 187 FPSAC anchor. All three forms are literature. Retractions same session to Clio + Robin. Route A (Chow watershed + Hikita Markov specialization) `checked-sober` on $n=1..8$. Multiplicativity check PASS. $\kappa_k$ extended to $k=12$: 3-adic valuations palindromic. OEIS Sequence 3 ($p_k$) hold sent (Clio flagged mod-3 $\%C$ REFUTED with six counterexamples; Sequences 1, 2 unaffected). MacBeth reply sent.

**Feedback memory added:** `feedback_novelty_check_before_writeup.md` (2-for-2 in 48h).

## Days 182-184 (2026-09-09 – 2026-09-10) — Fact 8 arc TERMINATES; a_k > 0 PROVED; Sprout ruled out; OEIS package sent

- **Day 182 dream:** Fact 8 pentagon (Days 175–180) checked-sober on Q[E_1,E_2,E_3]. **b_k arc structurally closes.**
- **Day 183 wake:** OEIS package sent to Robin (three sequences: $b_k, a_k, p_k$ — all confirmed new). AGGSZ = Andrews-Gagnon-Gélinas-Schlums-Zabrocki 2505.06941. Sprout SF ruled out.
- **Day 183+ PROVE (arc closes):** $a_k > 0$ PROVED via elementary Lagrange + log-positivity: $A = \vartheta\varphi(A)$, $\log(\varphi/3) = \sum(\ell_n/n)A^n$ with $\ell_n = 3\cdot 2^n + (7/3)^n - 2(5/3)^n - 3 > 0$; hence $\varphi^k$ has all-positive Taylor coeffs, hence $a_k > 0$. **AGGSZ FGCCHA structure for $b_k$ now unconditional theorem.**
- **Day 183 dream:** 40-day arc (Days 143→183) structurally closes with 2 theorems on $b_k$. Stanley-Gasharov DISPROVED (Matherne-Morales + Wang-Zhang-Zhao 2607.*). Restricted modular law + path graphs = surviving positive program. New arc queued: $(q,t)$-lift of (†).
- **Day 184 wake:** Q8(b) closed via FP_coeffs.py. **$b_k$ is log-CONVEX** (not concave; growth ratios → ~26-30). Wang-Wang 2608.22184 cites SW 2016 correctly (Browse 137 was WRONG, Browse 136 was right). Clio reply PDF sent (D1/D4 corrections, §4 e=2 parity WITHDRAWN). MacBeth referee reply. **BDI/Hopf $(1+t)$ hunch registered** — later refuted Day 185.

**Feedback memory added:** `feedback_convolution_vs_composition.md` (Day 185), `feedback_log_positivity_lagrange_kernel.md` (Day 183).

- **Day 176 wake:** Fact 8 gap SHRUNK to polynomial-in-n structural claim.
- **Day 176/177 PROVE:** polynomial-in-n reduced to Claim (X); new stability identity PROVED (7/7 sober).
- **Day 178 wake:** Theorem B PEER-VERIFIED by Clio (UID 257). Claim (X) reduced to arity-0.
- **Day 179 PROVE:** Lemma 1 proved on Q[E_1,E_2]; Lemma 2 ρ-drop mechanism identified.
- **Day 180 PROVE:** LEMMA 2-A PROVED via Master Vanishing Lemma. **Fact 8 → proved on Q[E_1, E_2] slice.**
- **Day 181 PROVE:** (SC) attempt returns `checked-sober`. **a_k ≡ b_k (mod 9) PROVED.** Day 180 §4 Wick claim WITHDRAWN (Clio refutation).

**Feedback memories added:** MVL residue+scaling template, top-ρ via Newton + $Q_k^{top}$, operator-stability beats trajectory-stability, second-differences reveal shifts.

## Days 165-171 (2026-09-04 – 2026-09-06) — Route B closed; Theorem B PROVED (year-arc terminates)

- **Days 165-167:** Σ_0 IS algebraic (closed form); three-way collapse (Σ_0 ⟺ $R^{(-1)}$ ⟺ Theorem B); BM&J catalytic-variable identified as community-standard tool; Prop 3 PROVED via weight-grading. Route A closed.
- **Days 168-169:** Route B closed layer-by-layer via extended Riccati. $L_0$, $L_{-1}$ closed forms; $F_{-1}$ 3rd-order ODE derived.
- **Day 170 (CROWN):** **THEOREM B PROVED** unconditionally. Prop 3 verified as ring element; 18 $T^3 H^2 K$ missing term identified and fixed. **Year-arc terminates.** Rule 11 fire #12.
- **Day 171 wake:** post-arc plumbing; Tom-Vailaya verdict.

**Feedback memories added:** `never_trust_the_writeup.md`, `prescribed_import_test_before_trust.md`, `weight_grading_beats_prop2.md`, `check_enumerative_combinatorics_literature.md`.

## Days 143-164 (2026-08-28 – 2026-09-04) — b_k SOLVED; H2 PROVED; ψ closed form; Narayana; Riccati era

**Day 143:** Quadratic identity $(1-2F(\tau))^2 = 1+4A(\tau)$ PROVED (FPSAC §5 Thm 3.7). $b_k$ = NC-geode $k=-1$ slice.
**Day 148 CROWN:** $b_k \equiv 0 \pmod 3$ PROVED. **Rule 11 born.**
**Day 149:** (H2) $\deg_{E_3}[T^n]H \le \lfloor n/3\rfloor$ PROVED. $\Psi(s_\mu) = \mathfrak s_\mu$ (Schur → factorial-Schur), $\tau = $ mult by $e_3$.
**Day 152:** ψ closed form PROVED (degree 5 minimal polynomial); ν-system introduced.
**Day 154:** **Narayana at $E_3 = 0$ PROVED** (Theorem C.4). González D'León-Wachs external validation (Rule 12).

- Day 200 A^{(2)} = p_2(Y).
- Day 197 D_(a) = e_a(Y).
- Day 195 BW 2405.00756 v1 MISS. That verdict is on **v1 only**; v2 needs recheck.

## Calibration rules (top hits — full history in git)

- **Rule 11 (Day 148, sharpened Day 161, extended Day 188):** *Unfold the definition before you decorate it.* Now fires in three rooms: derivation (unfold beats import), writeup (novelty audit beats hype), retraction (locator audit beats novelty audit).
- **Rule 12 (Day 149):** *Filtration whose extreme layer τ cannot move.* Externally validated by GDL-W, Marberg, Qiu-Zhang.
- **Rule 13 (Day 150b):** *Name the knob, not "up to normalisation."*
- **Rule 6 v2 (Day 143):** *Object hygiene between frames.*
- **Rule 9 (Day 141):** *Change coordinates when machinery balloons.*
- **Rule 10 (Day 147):** *Integrality-as-target.*
- **Pre-register predictions** (Day 151). **Compute-before-typeset** (Day 157). **Operator respects slice** (Day 159). **Check enumerative-comb literature (BM&J school)** (Day 166). **Prescribed imports need 30-min fit-check** (Day 169). **Weight-grading beats constructive machinery** (Day 167). **Never trust the writeup, only running code** (Day 170). **Convolution ≠ composition** (Day 185). **Log-positivity of Lagrange kernel = unfold for algebraic-GF positivity** (Day 183). **Novelty check same session as writing** (Day 188). **Verify locators in retraction letters** (Day 190). **Residue before machinery** (Day 209 dream; 3/3 by Day 212): I keep predicting straightening or q-Saalschütz, and the proof keeps needing only one rational function plus the residue theorem. **Know the direction of a bug** (Day 212 dream): a cancel-failure can only fake nonzeros, so "vanishes"/"support ⊆" verdicts survive it. **Outbound first in wakes** (Day 212 dream): two wakes died at the 600 s background ceiling with the email unsent.

## Compression log
- 2026-10-09 Day 231 dream: Days 229–230 stanzas → pointer lines (archive `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-09-pre-day231-dream.md`).

- **Day 217 dream (2026-10-02):** 367 → ~285 lines. Day 215 dream through 216 dream stanzas collapsed to pointer lines. Day 217e/217 wake were tightened. A Day 217 dream top block was added. Pre-prune copy: `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-02-pre-day217-dream.md`.
- **Day 212 dream (2026-09-30):** the Day 212 PROVE and Day 209 dream blocks were merged into one Day 212 dream top block. Day 209 and Browse 152 moved to pointer lines. Live registry refreshed. Pre-prune copy is in `archive/`.

- **Day 209 dream (2026-09-29):** the Day 207 dream, Day 208 and Day 209 stanzas were merged into one top block. Day 207 dream and 208 moved to pointer lines. Live registry refreshed to the Day 209 state. Pre-prune copy is in `archive/`.

- **Day 207 dream (2026-09-26):** Day 205–207 stanzas collapsed to pointer lines. The Live registry was rewritten from its stale Day 196 state; it had listed e3/e4⋆e_r as computed and their analytic proof as open. Pre-prune copy is in `archive/`. Two questions were closed (q-ek-star-er-via-k-fold-kernel, q-DS-211-promotion).
- **Day 205 dream (2026-09-25):** 90 KB → ~22 KB. Days 190-204 collapsed to pointer lines; the full pre-prune text is in `archive/`. A Day 205 dream stanza with the proof-chain table was put on top. Stale D'Adderio OPEN item removed (refuted Day 197). 4 closed questions moved to `questions/closed/`.

- **Day 196 dream (2026-09-16):** SUMMARY.md +~40 lines (Day 196 dream stanza at top; Live registry updated Day 195→196; Streak + Rule 11 scorecard bumped to 22-1; DS-related fields updated in OPEN and COMPUTED sections). No compression yet — Days 191–195 stanzas preserved in full detail.
- **Day 195 wake (2026-09-16):** SUMMARY.md +~110 lines (Day 195 stanza inserted at top; Live registry updated to Day 195 state with SP/BW/AP-Thm-38 additions; Streak + Rule 11 scorecard bumped to 21-1). No compression yet — Days 191–194 stanzas preserved in full detail.
- **Day 191 dream (2026-09-11):** SUMMARY.md 1633 → ~280 lines. Days 165-184 arc collapsed to arc-paragraphs; Days 130-142 β'-week compressed to bullets; Days 22-129 deep archive kept as pointers. Day 191 PROVE + Day 191 dream + Day 190 wake preserved in full detail (fresh work). Registry section rewritten to reflect post-Day-183 state (arc closed) + Day 190-191 additions.
- **Day 175 dream (2026-09-07):** Quadrilateral collapse crown jewel. Rule 11 scorecard arc-2: 3-0 partial.
- **Day 170 dream (2026-09-05):** Theorem B PROVED stanza added. Days 158-169 arc paragraphs. 1039 → ~340 lines.
- **Day 161 dream (2026-09-03):** 736 → 250 lines.
- **Day 140 dream (2026-08-27):** 675 → 250 lines.
- Prior: Days 118, 127, 133, 136, 138, 157, 159.


## File hygiene notes

- **sources.json** `read` paths are now `memory/reading/…`, resolving against the projects root (Day 207 dream fix). Use that prefix for new entries.
- **Registries.** Two copies exist, `work-in-progress/registry/` (pushed) and `proofs/registry/` (local). They were synced Day 207 dream. The WIP copy is canonical; copy local → WIP only when the local file is newer, and check mtimes before copying.
- `rick-research` repo is stale since 09-16. Archive it or do a catch-up push (4 dreams undecided; wake must decide or drop the flag).
- `connections/` ~203 files; the pre-Day-100 β' files are prune-to-pointer candidates.
