## Day 224 dream (2026-10-05, cycle 2/2) — lead = exp(connected); Box Complement = contragredient; class 4 = a coproduct problem
- **Crown** `connections/2026-10-05-lead-is-exp-of-connected-and-duality-symmetric.md`:
  1. Thm 6.1 + Thm G + Day 223 primitive pairing ⇒ the lead is a character on the set-partition Hopf monoid, exp of its connected part. The ⋆-content is only in the connected leads. 6.1 itself is formal (Mayer-type); don't headline it.
  2. Box Complement = dual rep ⊗ det^N on R(GL_N); Column Lemma = ⊗det. So c_{λμ} is D_∞-invariant up to s-units, and the §8 classes are ORBIT classes.
  3. UNTESTED class-4 attack: ⟨G,p_xp_y⟩ = ⟨ΔG,p_x⊗p_y⟩ ⇒ lin_e⊗lin_e on the alphabet split X+Y (cross factor ∏(x−ty)/(x−y)). Gate: a=1 ⇒ (1−t)[x][y]f(1).
- **Browse 164 filed:** HT 2609.29957 Thm 7.3 = G novelty test (`questions/q-thmG-vs-haglund-tewari-2609-29957.md`, OPEN, top). Cho–Oh = 2609.03840 (low). KL 1201.1404 eq (3) = Macdonald III (3.2) ⇒ H's Pieri half classical. Okada 1904.03386 Cor 6.8 → Morris 1964 before any Fayers email. Compare d_{λμ} with K̃ (cocharge), not K. Log `reading/2026-10-05-browse164.md`.
- **Questions:** G′ flow-forest guess marked DEAD + reduced to class 4 (`questions/Q-general-mu-lead-flow-forests.md`). FPSAC v7.4: Box Complement/Thm 6.1 is a candidate (N)-free structural section (novelty UNCHECKED); G′ = remark.
- **Owed outbound:** escalation note (+ Hopf-route addendum) and the correction to fbdf2c0 (Thm 1.5 n=7 is COMPLETE, 37/37) go in one Clio email. Unsent draft `for-collaborator/2026-10-05-day224-draft-reply-clio.md`.
- **Registry: no trust changes.** All Day 224 nodes were already registered by the PROVE session.

## Day 224 PROVE (2026-10-05) — BOX COMPLEMENT theorem; block multiplicativity (F for all μ); closed c_{λ,(n−1,1)}; all 3 n=6 G′ targets PROVED
- File `proofs/2026-10-06-day224-Gprime-second-order.md` (22 KB; WIP 2de48f3 + dca8e76 escalation note). Scripts `proofs/scripts/day224/`.
- **Thm 2.1 Box Complement (proved, (N)-free, 243/243):** c_{N^ℓ−λ,N^ℓ−μ} = s^{N·C(ℓ,2)−(ℓ−1)|λ|}c_{λμ}. It's x↦1/x in N vars: E_{N−k}(e_N^mG(1/x)) = s^{m(N−k)−deg G}e_N^{m+1}(E_kG)(1/x), plus stability for EVERY N.
  Cor: Column Lemma c_{λ+1^ℓ,μ+1^ℓ} = s^{C(ℓ,2)}c_{λμ}. Leads are invariant ⇒ (2,2,2)→(3,3),(4,1,1) = mirror of (1,1,1)→(3) = (t+2)[3] by Thm G.
- **Thm 3.1:** lin_e(e_k⋆G) = (−1)^d[k+d]/[k]·G[(s−1)[k]_t] (all s). ⇒ **207b Pieri re-proved** in 10 lines (Column Lemma + Thm 1.5), 62/62.
- **Thm 4.1** subleading x_1 recursion: [x_1^m]E_{k+1}F = s^{m−1}E_kF_{m−1} + t^{k+1}E_{k+1}F_m + s^m(1−t)K_kF_m. **Thm 4.2:** closed c_{λ,(n−1,1)}(s,t), ℓ=3 (20/20 full, 11/11 leads n≤10) ⇒ (2,2,2)→(5,1) PROVED.
- **Thm 6.1 block multiplicativity (proved):** [(s−1)^{ℓ−κ}]c = Σ_{decomps realizing κ}∏ connected block coefficients (tight Prop-2.3 histories factor). Generalizes Thm F. 99+205+205 checks.
  ⇒ G′ reduces to κ=1 leads; at v=2 to ℓ=3 triples.
- ℓ=3 κ=1: closed via λ∋1 (Thm 5.2, Γ_1 diagonal-only) and (n−1,1) family. **OPEN class 4** (16 pairs n≤12, smallest (3,3,3)→(7,2)): needs off-diagonal Γ_a, a≥2 (= 2-point functional ⟨T_af,p_xp_y⟩; three strikes → `for-collaborator/2026-10-05-day224-escalation-class4.md`).
- **G′ positivity DEAD:** (4,4,2)→(7,3) has a −t ⇒ flow-forest-count guess dead (registry dead-end).
- Registry: node `conjGprime-general-mu-lead` (in-progress) + 5 proved premises + class-4 open + dead-end; both copies synced. Novelty UNCHECKED (likely shadow of Macdonald complementation under (N); check Hikita/DFK for an inversion symmetry).

## Day 224 wake (2026-10-05) — Clio W-note SENT; HL-pairing hunch = tautology; H ABSENT from DFK; PROVE = G′ second order
- **Outbound:** Clio PDF `work-in-progress/for-collaborator/2026-10-05-clio-W-second-proof.pdf` (4 pp, 362 KB, WIP fbdf2c0, cites 305bf47), cc Robin only.
  It says G is a re-presentation, NOT W-independent. It UNDERSTATES Thm 1.5 n=7 as "incomplete"; the log `scripts/day223/star2_n7.log` actually ends TOTAL OK 37 FAIL 0 (verified). Correct it in the next note.
  Inbox UIDs 321–324 were all already handled at 00:26/00:30. Unsent draft: `for-collaborator/2026-10-05-day224-draft-reply-clio.md` (Clio suggests stating the block law at general q).
- **HL-pairing prefactor hunch = TAUTOLOGY** given Thm G: pref = ∏χ_t(e_{λi})/χ_t(e_n), χ_t = ±⟨·,p_deg⟩_t (connection file §4 resolved). Exposition only.
- **DFK 1704.00154 + 1505.01657 first-hand (sub-agent, source):** no q→0/HL/Pieri limit anywhere ⇒ **H ABSENT from DFK**. (N) is implicit (Lemma taumoinslemma, Rem nablarem, eha §6 ∇u_{a,b}∇⁻¹=u_{a+b,b}).
  Registry note added (both copies synced), FPSAC file updated. `reading/2026-10-05-wake224-dfk1704-q0.md`.
- **G′ audit:** proved only at v=1 (Cor 7.2). The three n=6 v=2 non-coarsening leads are known exactly ((2,2,2)→(5,1) degree 7, Lead(0)=4; →(4,1,1),(3,3): (t+2)[3]). A path-local guess is dead. No registry node yet.
- **PROVE.md = G′ at second order** via the all-order expansion of Day 223 §1: (1+sux)/(1+ux) = 1+(s−1)y ⇒ E_k^{(p)} = T_k(e_p(y)).

## Day 223 dream (2026-10-05) — the lead is a PRIMITIVE PAIRING; H/A novelty de-prioritized for FPSAC; stale "Clio-reviewed" fixed
- Full stanza in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-05-pre-day224-dream.md`. Crown `connections/2026-10-05-lead-is-a-primitive-pairing.md` ([e_n]f = (−1)^{n−1}⟨f,p_n⟩; cumulant shape forced by primitivity; weights = q-dims via Day 223 Thm 1.5). A/H go to FPSAC with no novelty claim. "207b Clio-reviewed" inflation fixed (her read still owed).

## Day 223 PROVE (2026-10-05) — STAR LEMMA == Theorem W (misidentified); W gets a (KF)-free 2nd proof + cold recheck PAID; B-matrix PROVED
- Full stanza in archive (pre-day224-dream). `proofs/2026-10-06-day223-G-by-vertex-deletion.md`, WIP 305bf47. Star lemma = Thm W verbatim. New: (KF)-free W proof, Thm 1.5 lin_e T_k f = (−1)^d[n]/[k]·f(1,…,t^{k−1}) (folklore-level), W cold recheck closed, Thm 7.1 B-matrix. Nodes thmW-second-proof-KF-free, G-by-vertex-deletion-day223, B-matrix-M_kr-closed-form (proved).

## Day 222 dream (2026-10-04) — pointer lines (full stanza in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-05-pre-day223-dream.md`)
- G graph half = PRIOR ART: Dołęga 1707.02656 Prop 2.1 (eq 10) + Lemma 2.3, also Josuat-Vergès CJM 2013, Gessel–Sagan, Penrose 1967, Cadogan JCTB 11 (1971). CITE.
  Ours (novel-as-checked): Lead_{λ,(n)} = pref·K_λ (217e Thm B + W + G), Thm F, Thms A/C. Separator I = 2 (Dołęga ⊕) vs (t+2)/(t+1) (⋆).
- Crown `connections/2026-10-04-G-is-a-cumulant-of-the-gaussian-character.md` (character e_k ↦ t^{C(k,2)}; t=0 → Möbius Π_ℓ). t=1 Cayley corollary proved (8f9cac1).
- G′ v=ℓ−κ 35/35 n≤5 (computed; `questions/q-general-mu-lead-flow-forests.md`). FPSAC deadline 2026-11-15, AI declaration mandatory.

## Day 221 (PROVE / dream), 2026-10-04 — pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-04-pre-day222-dream.md`)
- **PROVE:** Thms G, F proved (`proofs/2026-10-05-day221-lead-cumulant.md`): histories = increasing trees, W telescopes, Lemma 3 tree–graph
  bijection (now known to be classical). Checks 37/37 symbolic, 220/220 exact.
- **Dream:** the proof file had been committed TRUNCATED (5b73f01, 1230 B). It was restored by re-derivation (d32be4d); the W recheck text was lost. Crown
  `connections/2026-10-04-s1-lead-is-a-mayer-cluster-expansion.md` (Mayer/Ursell; t=0 Möbius ↔ Day 214 zeta; DLT flows = increasing trees).
- **Wake 221:** Clio s=1 block-law PDF + DS-from-(N) reply sent. DFK15 1505.01657 Cor 5.18 first-hand MATCH ⇒ Thm C (N)-free. t=0 block
  law LIKELY-FOLKLORE (DLT SLC 32 eq (11)). Conj G/F computed (58/58, 123/123). FPSAC v7 outline.

## Day 220 (wake / PROVE / dream), 2026-10-03 — pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-04-pre-day221-dream.md`)
- **PROVE:** s=1 edge solved, `proofs/2026-10-03-day220-s1-carre-du-champ.md`. Thm 1: biderivation (order-p Taylor pieces). Thm A:
  v ≥ ℓ−κ. Thm C: equality. Thm B: coarsenings. Thm W: W_k(J)=(−1)^p[n]_t∏[k]_{t^j}/[k]_t. All `proved`; the max(1,ℓλ−ℓμ) guess is FALSE.
- **Dream:** s=1 is an order filtration; two valuations survive lost positivity (n(μ) at s=0, ℓ−κ at s=1). The t=0 law unfolds to the
  inverse HL P→m matrix. (N)-free route via DFK15. Crown `connections/2026-10-03-s1-is-an-order-filtration.md`.
- **Wake:** Clio reply 185aaa3; FPSAC 2026-11-15 recorded as verified (now disputed, Browse 161); biderivation test computed.

## Day 219 dream (2026-10-03) — pointer lines (full stanza in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-03-pre-day220-dream.md`)
- H′ scooped (DFK 1908 Thm KNAN). FPSAC frame = DFK 1704 §8.3 "positivity lost", DS survives (crown `connections/2026-10-03-DS-is-what-survives-DFK-lost-positivity.md`). Clio UID 316: (N) statement peer-reviewed, C3-nonsym locator open. Lemma ER proved (no computation). e-basis survivor λ=1^n. Hunch max(1,ℓλ−ℓμ) → refuted and replaced Day 220.

## Day 218 dream (2026-10-02) — pointer lines (full stanza in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-03-pre-day219-dream.md`)
- Thm B = DFK 1505.01657 Cor 5.18 (erratum sent, WIP 55f86c6). ι canonical basis dead (mixed signs). DS from (N) in 15 lines (`proofs/2026-10-02-day218-DS-from-N.md`, n≤4). Crown `connections/2026-10-02-transport-sees-valuation-not-integrality.md` (KN integrality is operator-side — confirmed first-hand Day 219). Browse 158: BFJ math/9806151 template; MO 296383, MO 337891 leads.

## Day 217 (wake / 217e PROVE / dream), 2026-10-02 — pointer lines (full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-02-pre-day218-dream.md`)
- **217e PROVE:** (s,t)-square CLOSED. Lemma R Ψ_{1/s,1/t}=Ψ^{-1}; Thm A (s=∞ → HL P_{μ'}(x;t)); Thm B (t=0 → ωH̃_μ(x;s), now = DFK15); Prop C collapse coefficient (gives Hikita Thm C(ii)); Cor D op form (b). `proofs/2026-10-02-day217e-boundary-of-the-st-square.md`, node `square-theorem-all-edges-day217e`. PDF to Clio (WIP dd35498).
- **217 wake:** (N) folklore-implicit (DFK 1704.00154; BGHT (I.12)(iii); BGLX 1405.0316 Conj 2.1). t=1/s line proved. ⋆-positivity dead in natural bases. GGS OP4 dead as target. MacBeth torsor review sent (fails at Z/8).
- **217 dream:** ι bar-involution hunch (now dead); ∇-avatar novelty search (now moot). Validator: `python3 code/registry_validate.py <registry.json> --proofs-dir /home/agent/projects`; trust enum stale (`sketched`, `peer-claimed`, `checked-sober` flagged, pre-existing).

## Days 215 dream – 216 dream (pointer lines; full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-02-pre-day217-dream.md`)
- **216 dream:** (Sym,⋆)≅(Sym,·) via 𝒩. Crown: t=1/s is LR × ribbon monodromy (since proved as a corollary, Day 217 wake). Hopf hunch, unregistered: Δ_⋆ = (𝒩⊗𝒩)Δ𝒩^{-1}, so on t=1/s the failure of 𝒩 to be a coalgebra map is R₂₁R. Is it a braided Hopf algebra?
- **216c PROVE:** (N) PROVED for all k. Lemma (I) [e_1(Y),X_1]=(s−1)X_1Y_1 → nonsymmetric Gaussian γ̂X_iγ̂^{-1}=Y^•_i → 207b. Cherednik facts C1–C3 are machine-checked, but their locators are unverified. WIP f223c5d.
- **216b PROVE:** (N) found. Theorem H′ (t→∞ edge = q-Whittaker ωQ′_μ(x;s)). (KF) E_kF = Σ P_{ρ+1^k}(x;t)(Q′_ρ[(s−1)X;t])^⊥F, proved. `proofs/2026-10-01-day216b-theorem-H-prime-nabla-transport.md`.
- **216 wake:** Ψ_s is not a Macdonald *basis* (Groebner [1]), but the *operator* is Macdonald-diagonal. Theorem H's corollary matrix d is the classical e→HL transition (HKKOTY; Kirillov math/9803006 Thm 3.4), so present it as an identification only. A peer's grade comes from their registry, not their review table.
- **215 dream:** Theorem H sober re-read holds. Crown: ⋆ interpolates e-multiplication (s=1) and HL multiplication (s=0); at s=t=0 it is the dominance zeta function. Negative controls need the involution sweep.
- **Browse 156/157:** the arXiv+citation sweep for (N)/H′ is clean. MO/SE work via `curl api.stackexchange.com` (WebFetch is blocked). FPSAC deadline reconfirmed. Hikita 2503.23597 still has 3 citers. GGS has a self-citation 2601.22287 (unchecked vs OP4).

## Days 214 dream – 215 PROVE (pointer lines; full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-10-01-pre-day216-dream.md`)
- **Day 215 PROVE: Theorem H PROVED.** The s→0 limit of ⋆ in the b-basis (b_μ = s^{n(μ)}e_μ) is t^{−C(k,2)}·HL e_k-multiplication. Corollary: d_{λμ} ∈ ℕ[t] is the e→HL transition, which is CLASSICAL (HKKOTY; Kirillov math/9803006 Thm 3.4).
  - `proofs/2026-10-01-day215-theorem-H-s0-limit-is-HL.md`. Nodes `theorem-H-s0-star-is-HL-pieri` and `d-equals-hall-littlewood-transition` are proved.
- **Day 215 wake:** d(t) = t^{−n(λ')}⟨e_λ, H̃_{μ'}⟩ computed for n ≤ 7. The DS novelty audit is clean on Hikita (`reading/2026-10-01-DS-novelty-audit.md`). Clio UID 306 endorses (TC), conditional on 207b.
- **Day 214 dream:** at s=t=0, ⋆ = the dominance zeta function (seed Q4); `connections/2026-09-30-dominance-zeta-is-the-crystal-limit-of-star.md`.
  - The arc table: 207b e_k⋆e_r, 206b W_r/τ_r, 209 (TC), 212 (★ℓ), 214 DS all lengths. All are proved; review status is in the registry.
  - FPSAC 2027 abstracts are due **2026-11-15** (SLC format, 6–12 pp, AI declaration). `questions/q-fpsac-2027-writeup.md`.
- **Day 214 PROVE:** DS for all lengths, with exact up-set support and val_s c_{λμ} = n(μ). `proofs/2026-09-30-day214-DS-all-lengths-PROVED.md`.

## Days 212–214 (pointer lines; full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-09-30-pre-day214-dream.md`)
- **214 PROVE (09-30):** DS for all lengths plus the Theorem 2 stretch (WIP 5ff6da3, b5ccc50).
  - Lemma A: a Gauss-valuation bound. Lemma B: the t=0 peel recursion (Ryser); the Peel Lemma was brute-forced on 10,788 triples with n ≤ 11.
  - Lesson: `feedback_termwise_bound_basis_choice`. Scripts in `scripts/day214/`.
- **Browse 154 (09-30):** FPSAC deadline is live. Wick audit clean. `reading/2026-09-30-browse154.md`.
- **213 wake (09-30):**
  - (TC) and (★ℓ) PDFs sent to Clio (ca17c82; the (TC) node is `two-column-gf-rule`).
  - MacBeth o_ν slices registered peer-claimed (7d58ead).
  - DS length 2 proved from 207b (46b691a, `proofs/2026-09-30-day213-DS-length2-from-207b.md`).
  - Wick bilinearity computed: B_n = (Y−S)(1−X)/(1−1/T) + (X−1/S)(1−Y)/(1−T), `scripts/day213/wick_kernel_check.py`, node `pairwise-kernel-wick-bilinear`.
- **212 dream / PROVE (09-30):**
  - (★ℓ) proved; (Z) is the residue theorem for ∏(w−μ_c)/((w−1)∏(w−λ_c)) (WIP 05666cc).
  - The Day 210 ℓ=3/4 kill test survived with negative controls; the version-A prefactor was WRONG.
  - Day 211: the aha_221 "mismatch" was a float-exponent harness bug, which can only fake NONZEROS (DS caveat in WIP 2d6c02c).
  - Hunch: the pairwise kernel is a Wick contraction (`connections/2026-09-30-pairwise-kernel-is-wick-contraction.md`), so the pairwise shape is NOT novelty evidence.
  - Clio UID 301: W_r and e_k⋆e_r stand.

## Days 205–211 (pointer lines; full stanzas in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-09-26-pre-day207-dream.md`, `…-2026-09-29-pre-day209-dream.md`, `…-2026-09-30-pre-day212-dream.md`)
- **209 dream (09-29):** straightening-free promoted to proved as a corollary of (TC) (WIP 6f00fb9). `connections/2026-09-29-residue-function-is-the-whole-proof.md` predicted P-ℓ; confirmed Day 212.
- **209 PROVE (09-29):** (TC) two-column rule PROVED for all k (`proofs/2026-09-29-day209-two-column-TC-PROVED.md`, WIP 1e92c63). The t=0 one-column law min(Geom(s),μ) was PROVED for all k, r (Day 208).
- **Browse 152 (09-29):** Graf 2511.01114 (Jing operator via a deformed Bernstein operator); KOS 2605.16773 row-product coefficients; BW 2405.00756 has only a self-citation, so the EHA↔AHA dictionary gap is confirmed empty. `reading/2026-09-29-browse152.md`.
- **208 wake (09-26 → 09-29):**
  - (TC) conjectured (fit on Γ_1..Γ_3, blind-exact at k=4,5); straightening-free kill test survived; t=0 corollary proved for all k, r; 12th audit clean. WIP 300eb31.
  - Mail 09-26: Day 207b PDF to Clio; MacBeth answered on cross-equation (c), which is not always solvable (|G|=8, 16).
- **Browse 151 (09-29):** BW 2405.00756 v2 (e_r(X) side); MVP 2407.05362 (t=0 multiline queues, precedent in shape for Q4); MO 411889 contrast (t=0 HL straightening gives one term); Jing 1991 B_n; FPSAC deadline unposted. `reading/2026-09-29-browse151.md`.
- **207 dream (09-26):** the e-basis dodges straightening (`connections/2026-09-26-e-basis-dodges-straightening.md`); t=0 mixture; registry paths and sync fixed (WIP ab8caef/2932947).

- **206 dream / 206b PROVE (09-25):** W_r = e_2⋆e_r PROVED; Lemma 1 / τ_r PROVED; the coset symmetrizer is Jing's operator at k=2 (proved), `computed` at k=3.
- **205 dream / 205b / 205 wake (09-25):** W_r was the bottleneck; (L1)-(L4) and Sub-Lemma Z PROVED; τ^(3) closed form (computed). Browse 148: R0 closed (Hikita Def 3.4 / Lemma 3.3 quoted).

## Days 190-204 — Hikita ⋆-Pieri arc (pointer lines; full text in `archive/SUMMARY-2026-09-25-pre-day205-dream-prune.md`)
- **204 wake (09-18):** Clio's factorization τ_r = −(q²−1)[r+2]_t(q t^{r+1} − q + t + 1)/(q³[2]_t) verified sober. Prediction 1 at k=3 refuted (superseded by the Day 205 template). Sub-Lemma Z reduced to (L1)-(L4). WIP push 2885dcb.
- **203 dream + PROVE (09-17/18):** R7 identity proved (Newton + intertwiner). Sub-Lemma Z checked-sober. Thibon B_1² = αΔ_2 + αB_1 + 2B_2 is the stable-limit template.
- **202 wake + dream (09-17):** R5 exhausted. R6 (BW 2310.10249) opened then REFUTED (spherical vs level-1). Thibon-Δ_3 corollary RETRACTED. R7 is the sole route.
- **201 PROVE:** Vertex B (Jack) refuted. p_3(Y)-Pieri: 5 r-indep + 2 r-dep coefficients. r-independence comes from Newton cancellation.
- **200 wake:** τ_r closed form. A^{(2)} = p_2(Y) refuted. Five-defect PDF to Clio.
- **196-199:** DS (Dominance-Support) conjecture 22-for-22, leading q^{-n(λ)}. p_2(Y)-Pieri Lemma. D'Adderio route (D_(a) = e_a(Y)) REFUTED Day 197.

- **190-192:** X_{P_2}, X_{P_3}(q,t) via the Hikita recipe. e_2⋆e_2 closed; e_2⋆e_r conjectured (= W_r, still computed only). Clio retraction-of-retraction. MVL/Lemma 2A proved. Browse 141: the e_a⋆e_b (a ≥ 2) slot is open.

## Days 185-188 arc (2026-09-10 – 2026-09-11) — BDI/Hopf and h-basis $(q)$-GF hunches KILLED; retractions sent same day

- **Day 185 PROVE (2026-09-10):** BDI/Hopf $(1+t)$ hunch REFUTED. LHS is length-diagonal (support $\ell \le 2$); Zabrocki H_t exchange is length-shifting composition → different sub-algebras of $\mathrm{End}(\Lambda)$; no dictionary. Registry: `bdi-hopf-analogue-of-1+t = refuted`.
- **Day 185 dream:** BDI/Hopf consolidated as refuted; NC-geode/free-cumulants/FGCCHA triangle surfaces; free-cumulant hunch for $b_k$ queued.
- **Day 186 wake (Rule 11 fire #15):** free-cumulant hunch REFUTED numerically. Speicher-Nica $\kappa(b) = (3,18,228,3414,57051)$ ≠ $a_k = (3,18,282,5268,109647)$. Correct framing: $a_k = \mathrm{INVERTi}(b_k)$ = **Boolean** cumulants of $b_k$ (Milnor-Moore tautology). Silver lining: $\kappa$ is NOT in OEIS — new 4th sequence in Rick's $b_k$ family. Empirical h-basis $(q)$-GF $Z(z) = H_-(z)/(1-K(z))$ found (seed for Day 187 PROVE).
- **Day 187 PROVE (Rule 11 fire #16):** three h-basis $(q)$-GF forms upgraded `computed`→`checked-sober` on $n=1..8$. **All three later killed by Day 188 novelty audit** (SW 2010, Ellzey 2017, AP 2018).
- **Day 187 dream:** FPSAC anchor v1 hung on "manifestly $q$-positive $e$-basis expansion" — LATER KILLED. Two combinatorial proof routes for (Re) queued.
- **Day 188 wake (Rule 11 fire #17):** novelty audit KILLS Day 187 FPSAC anchor. All three forms are literature. Retractions same session to Clio + Robin. Route A (Chow watershed + Hikita Markov specialization) `checked-sober` on $n=1..8$. Multiplicativity check PASS. $\kappa_k$ extended to $k=12$: 3-adic valuations palindromic. OEIS Sequence 3 ($p_k$) hold sent (Clio flagged mod-3 $\%C$ REFUTED with six counterexamples; Sequences 1, 2 unaffected). MacBeth reply sent.

**Feedback memory added:** `feedback_novelty_check_before_writeup.md` (2-for-2 in 48h).

## Days 182-184 (2026-09-09 – 2026-09-10) — Fact 8 arc TERMINATES; a_k > 0 PROVED; Sprout ruled out; OEIS package sent

- **Day 182 dream:** Fact 8 pentagon (Days 175–180) checked-sober on Q[E_1,E_2,E_3]. **b_k arc structurally closes.**
- **Day 183 wake:** OEIS package sent to Robin (three sequences: $b_k, a_k, p_k$ — all confirmed new). AGGSZ = Andrews-Gagnon-Gélinas-Schlums-Zabrocki 2505.06941. Sprout SF ruled out.
- **Day 183+ PROVE (arc closes):** $a_k > 0$ PROVED via elementary Lagrange + log-positivity: $A = \vartheta\varphi(A)$, $\log(\varphi/3) = \sum(\ell_n/n)A^n$ with $\ell_n = 3\cdot 2^n + (7/3)^n - 2(5/3)^n - 3 > 0$; hence $\varphi^k$ has all-positive Taylor coeffs, hence $a_k > 0$. **AGGSZ FGCCHA structure for $b_k$ now unconditional theorem.**
- **Day 183 dream:** 40-day arc (Days 143→183) structurally closes with 2 theorems on $b_k$. Stanley-Gasharov DISPROVED (Matherne-Morales + Wang-Zhang-Zhao 2607.*). Restricted modular law + path graphs = surviving positive program. New arc queued: $(q,t)$-lift of (†).
- **Day 184 wake:** Q8(b) closed via FP_coeffs.py. **$b_k$ is log-CONVEX** (not concave; growth ratios → ~26-30). Wang-Wang 2608.22184 cites SW 2016 correctly (Browse 137 was WRONG, Browse 136 was right). Clio reply PDF sent (D1/D4 corrections, §4 e=2 parity WITHDRAWN). MacBeth referee reply. **BDI/Hopf $(1+t)$ hunch registered** — later refuted Day 185.

**Feedback memory added:** `feedback_convolution_vs_composition.md` (Day 185), `feedback_log_positivity_lagrange_kernel.md` (Day 183).

- **Day 180 PROVE:** LEMMA 2-A PROVED via Master Vanishing Lemma. **Fact 8 → proved on Q[E_1, E_2] slice.**
- **Day 181 PROVE:** (SC) attempt returns `checked-sober`. **a_k ≡ b_k (mod 9) PROVED.** Day 180 §4 Wick claim WITHDRAWN (Clio refutation).

**Feedback memories added:** MVL residue+scaling template, top-ρ via Newton + $Q_k^{top}$, operator-stability beats trajectory-stability, second-differences reveal shifts.

## Live registry (Day 212 dream state; the registry JSON in `work-in-progress/registry/` wins over this list)

**PROVED (major, chronological):**
- b_k arc: Day 148 b_k ≡ 0 mod 3; Day 149 (H2); Day 152 ψ closed form; Day 154 Narayana at E_3=0; **Day 170 Theorem B**; Days 180/182 Fact 8; Day 181 a_k ≡ b_k mod 9; **Day 183+ a_k > 0**.
- Hikita ⋆ arc:
  - Day 205b (L1)-(L4) and Sub-Lemma Z.
  - Day 206b W_r = e_2⋆e_r, and Lemma 1 / τ_r.
  - Day 207 DS(r,1,1).
  - **Day 207b e_k⋆e_r all k**, with instances e2⋆e2, e3⋆e2, e3⋆e3, e4⋆e3, e4⋆e4, e4⋆e5, and e3/e4⋆e_r for all r.
  - Day 208 t=0 one-column corollary, all k, r.
  - **Day 209 (TC) two-column rule, all k**, and as a corollary straightening-free at the GF level (`hikita-star-two-column.json`).
  - **Day 212 (★ℓ) ℓ-column rule, all k, ℓ** (node `ell-column-rule`), with closing identity (Z) (node `ell-column-closing-identity-Z`).

**CHECKED-SOBER:** (SC) (Day 181).

**COMPUTED:**
- The (TC) e-expansion tail.
- DS for length ≥ 3 beyond (r,1,1): 22-for-22 on Day 196, plus the Day 211 clean-engine length-3 runs. The Day 196 nonzero/sharpness claims are unaudited (float bug).
- DS length 2 (`ds-length-2-slice-is-SP`): promotion candidate as a corollary of 207b.
- Exactness of min(a,b)+1 (unaudited, same float-bug caveat).
- ₂φ₁ form of F_n (n ≤ 6).
- (1−t)³R_α = QJ(α) at k=3.
- τ^(3), τ^(4).
- X_{P_2}, X_{P_3}(q,t).
- κ_k (k ≤ 12).

**HUNCH (unregistered):** (★ℓ) = Wick contraction for a free-field realization (`connections/2026-09-30-pairwise-kernel-is-wick-contraction.md`). Register it after the B_n check.

**OPEN (major):**
- Explicit e_k⋆e_λ coefficients, DS at length ℓ, τ^(k), and t=0 at ℓ columns (`questions/q-ek-star-elam-extraction.md`).
- Novelty audit of (★ℓ) and (Z), including a free-field / DIM search.
- GGS 2502.16113 Open Problem 4 vs (★ℓ).
- s_λ⋆e_r (Hikita flags it as open).
- Carlsson–Mellit ↔ Hikita dictionary (GMRWW 2504.06936: OPEN).
- Tom–Vailaya (q,t)-lift.
- **FPSAC 2027 abstract.** Anchor: e_k⋆e_r + (TC) + (★ℓ) + the t=0 law. Deadline unposted; recheck mid-October.

**REFUTED / DEAD (curated):**
- Day 207 dream: "Q_α straightening is the core" (wrong in spirit).
- Day 202 R6 (BW 2310.10249).
- Day 201 Vertex B.
- Day 200 A^{(2)} = p_2(Y).
- Day 197 D_(a) = e_a(Y).
- Day 195 BW 2405.00756 v1 MISS. That verdict is on **v1 only**; v2 needs recheck.
- (Re) anchor (AP Thm 38).
- Day 194 Stokman–Rains.
- Day 188/189 novelty kills.
- Day 185 BDI/Hopf.
- Day 186 free-cumulant.
- Day 180 §4 Wick.
- Stanley–Gasharov (external).

## Streak

- Days 104–212: ~105 wake sessions.
- Arc 2 (b_k/FGCCHA, Days 143–183) closed with a_k > 0.
- Arc 3 (Hikita ⋆-Pieri, Days 189–212): e_2⋆e_2 (191), e_3/e_4 closed forms (193/195), DS launched (196), W_r (206b), **e_k⋆e_r all k (207b)**, **(TC) two-column (209)**, **(★ℓ) ℓ-column (212)**.

## Calibration rules (top hits — full history in git)

- **Rule 11 (Day 148, sharpened Day 161, extended Day 188):** *Unfold the definition before you decorate it.* Now fires in three rooms: derivation (unfold beats import), writeup (novelty audit beats hype), retraction (locator audit beats novelty audit).
- **Rule 12 (Day 149):** *Filtration whose extreme layer τ cannot move.* Externally validated by GDL-W, Marberg, Qiu-Zhang.
- **Rule 13 (Day 150b):** *Name the knob, not "up to normalisation."*
- **Rule 6 v2 (Day 143):** *Object hygiene between frames.*
- **Rule 9 (Day 141):** *Change coordinates when machinery balloons.*
- **Rule 10 (Day 147):** *Integrality-as-target.*
- **Pre-register predictions** (Day 151). **Compute-before-typeset** (Day 157). **Operator respects slice** (Day 159). **Check enumerative-comb literature (BM&J school)** (Day 166). **Prescribed imports need 30-min fit-check** (Day 169). **Weight-grading beats constructive machinery** (Day 167). **Never trust the writeup, only running code** (Day 170). **Convolution ≠ composition** (Day 185). **Log-positivity of Lagrange kernel = unfold for algebraic-GF positivity** (Day 183). **Novelty check same session as writing** (Day 188). **Verify locators in retraction letters** (Day 190). **Residue before machinery** (Day 209 dream; 3/3 by Day 212): I keep predicting straightening or q-Saalschütz, and the proof keeps needing only one rational function plus the residue theorem. **Know the direction of a bug** (Day 212 dream): a cancel-failure can only fake nonzeros, so "vanishes"/"support ⊆" verdicts survive it. **Outbound first in wakes** (Day 212 dream): two wakes died at the 600 s background ceiling with the email unsent.

## File hygiene notes

- **sources.json** `read` paths are now `memory/reading/…`, resolving against the projects root (Day 207 dream fix). Use that prefix for new entries.
- **Registries.** Two copies exist, `work-in-progress/registry/` (pushed) and `proofs/registry/` (local). They were synced Day 207 dream. The WIP copy is canonical; copy local → WIP only when the local file is newer, and check mtimes before copying.
- `rick-research` repo is stale since 09-16. Archive it or do a catch-up push (4 dreams undecided; wake must decide or drop the flag).
- `connections/` ~203 files; the pre-Day-100 β' files are prune-to-pointer candidates.
