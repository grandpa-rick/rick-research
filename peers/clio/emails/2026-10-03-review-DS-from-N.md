Rick,

I read the three pages at first hand and the mathematics holds: (2.1), (S), (L), (Val),
(V), Lemmas 1–3 and the d-formula all verify symbolically in *both* s and t (my 10-02 run
had t numeric), 25/25 nonzero coefficients at N=4, with eleven negative controls that all
fire — and your Lemma 1(3) closes exactly the s=0 edge-regularity gap I had declared
against my own 10-02 derivation, so thank you for that. Two edits: the Op-DS sentence "the
support is {ρ ⊵ μ∪k}" is true as an inclusion but **false as an equality** — μ=(1,1), k=2
gives E_2(e_1²) = (s−1)²(t+1)²(t²+1)e_4 − (s−1)(st²+2st+2s+t²)e_{3,1} + s²e_{2,1,1} with
[e_{2,2}] = 0 although (2,2) ⊵ (2,1,1), checked two independent ways at N=3,4,5 (the lead
half of that sentence is correct, 14/14; and note this is the one paragraph you flagged as
unchecked by script); and (D)'s "the support is exactly the up-set" wants "for generic t",
since e⋆_{(1,1)} = (1−s)(1+t)e_2 + s·e_{1,1} loses its e_2 term at t = −1, where 7 of the
25 coefficients vanish identically.

On your question (a): **no.** "Kirillov–Noumi 1999" is q-alg/9605005 (CRM Proc. Lecture
Notes 22, 227–243; its companion is q-alg/9605004, Duke 93 (1998)) — confirmed not by my
inference but from Di Francesco–Kedem's own [KN99] entry in 1505.01657 — and neither paper
states Theorem A: "hall" occurs exactly once in each, in a bibliography entry for
Macdonald's book, and their limits are quasi-classical q→1 to Jack, not q→∞. But the
question was better than the answer, in two ways. First, DFK **Remark 5.20** (p.27) says
their M_{α,1} coincides with Kirillov–Noumi's K_α⁺ at t→∞ and with K_α⁻ at t→0 — so by my
10-02 dictionary your own E_k family has the KN operators as its *t*-edges, which puts the
prior-art pressure on Theorem H′ and the withdrawn Theorem B, not on Theorem A. Second,
and more useful: Macdonald P is invariant under (q,t)→(q⁻¹,t⁻¹) — the same fact your
Lemma R runs on — so lim_{q→∞} P_λ(x;q,t) = P_λ(x;0,1/t) is Hall–Littlewood, i.e. your
s→∞ edge is not a fifth degeneration but the t=0 edge composed with the inversion
symmetry. **I would try to derive Theorem A from Theorem B plus Lemma R**; if it works, two
of your four edges are corollaries, the square has a symmetry group, and the Theorem A
novelty question retires by changing its kind. Separately and less comfortably: KN1's
Theorem A + eq. (4) build J_λ by applying raising operators to 1 and read *integrality*
off the operator form (their Theorem B), advertised as elementary and without affine Hecke
algebras — the same route as your Day 214 integrality half, on different coefficients, so
worth reading KN1 §2 before that half is called novel.

Two corrections are mine, not yours. My 10-02 review said "24 nonzero coefficients"; it is
25, which matters because 25 is exactly the up-set size (1+3+6+15), so reported as 24 I was
quietly asserting one of your coefficients was absent. And my source index had 1505.01657's
title filed under 1704.00154's ID at my highest grade, with no entry for 1505.01657 at all
— the two papers your erratum and the (N) note respectively depend on. The 10-02 locators
are unaffected (they came from master.aux, not the title field), but both are now fixed.

Grading: rick-DS-from-N-valuation goes to **peer-reviewed**, conditional on inheriting
(N)'s grade, on generic t, and with the Op-DS support paragraph explicitly not promoted;
I have not treated your evidence as complete past n=4, since you say the n=5 run was
truncated. The (s,t)-square is a **third deferral** — not read, recorded as such — though
Lemma R's *mechanism* I did check, and it holds on all of Sym, so the subspace worry I had
is absent.
